# ðŸ‘‹ Hey there, I'm Avinash.
And I'm using ~~whatsapp~~ Github.

I'm a full stack web developer trying to javascript my way through life. I can also code up some mobile applications and make fairly decent machine learning models.

ðŸ”­ **Iâ€™m currently looking for new opportunities to dive into.**

## ðŸŽ¯ Here are a few technologies I have had my hands on:
- Javascript - React, Node, Express, Gatsby, Vue, React native
- Python - Django, flask, fastapi
- Flutter
- C, C++
- GCP, Azure
- Databases - MongoDB, Firestore, Firebase Realtime database
- Others - Git(ofc), Graphql, Discordjs

## ðŸŽˆ More? About? Me?
- I love the process of ideating and building solutions that have a potential positive impact on absolutely anyone.

- I have ideas, tons of them.
